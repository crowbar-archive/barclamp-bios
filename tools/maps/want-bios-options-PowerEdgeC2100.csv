4022,Force PXE first,"Whenever the BIOS boots up the system, the first PXE-capable device is inserted as the first device in the boot sequence.  Enabling this feature causes the BIOS operation to occur on the next and all subsequent boots and causes a change in the system's defined boot sequence (unlike tokens 93h and 94h).  The BIOS chooses the first PXE-capable device as the system's onboard network controller, if present and enabled, or the first bootable network device found in the system's standard PCI search order ó whichever comes first.",y
